# Dynamic Data Structures in C

This project is a full on scalable data structure base made with C for optimum performance.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/keybraker/Data-Structures-in-C.git
```

## How to run

Go to project directory

```
cd .../Data-Structures-in-C
```

Than choose one of two implementations

```
cd Dynamic\ Structs/
```

or

```
cd Dynamic\ Trees/
```

##### Both are illustrating the same project one with structures and one with trees.

Than all you have to do is run ```make``` to compile
And than run ```dataStructure "filename"``` to run a file through the database.

There are testfiles you can execute with ```make 1 to 11``` for structs --v and 'make 1 to 9'

## Cleanup

After your done  just run ```make clean``` and the compiled project will get erased
